```

VELOX_DEV_URL=http://localhost:5173 swift run {% swift_module_name %}
```

## Identifier

`{% identifier %}`

## Build Notes (macOS)

Velox builds a Rust FFI library via a SwiftPM build plugin. SwiftPM runs plugins
in a sandbox by default, which can block Cargo network access and prevent lock
file updates in read-only checkouts. Run the bootstrap target once before your
first build:

```bash
make bootstrap
```

`create-velox-app` attempts to run `make bootstrap` automatically on macOS. If
that fails, rerun it manually.

If the target cannot locate the Velox checkout, set `VELOX_PATH` manually:

```bash
VELOX_PATH=../velox make bootstrap
```

After bootstrap, regular `swift build` runs should work. If you generated this
project with `--velox-path`, the local checkout is already writable, but you may
still need `make bootstrap` for the initial Cargo dependency fetch.
